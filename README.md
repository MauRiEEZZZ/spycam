# ALL SEEING EYE
In an era where a "Big Brother" isn't necessarily someone that watches your back, social credits and behavior points are the new norm. CCTV cameras are kindly called security cameras, but who do they secure? and from whom? 
Even in this era, some manage to walk around - seeing everything but unseen by the system. For some, they are agents of change. For others, they are agents of treachery. 

The road to freedom of speech, in some states, is paved by these agents. Do you have what it takes to become one? Or at the very least, get the system to think you are one. Will you be one of those who are ignored by the system? 

Are you smarter than the system? Can you outsmart the state? Who has more neurons.. the system, or you?
